# mipt_databases

This repository contains stuff I've coded during my **"Relational Calculus and Databases"** course at MIPT

- `project`: my course project is a time-management app which command-line interface written in Python 3 using the PostgreSQL server for keeping the app data

- `assignments`: there are SQL request examples I've made as a homework solution
